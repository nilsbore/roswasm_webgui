# roswasm_webgui

roswasm_webgui is a library for writing web GUIs for ROS using [roswasm](https://github.com/nilsbore/roswasm)
and [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
It also provides example web interfaces, one of which is used for our [underwater robot](https://github.com/smarc-project).
The resulting web pages are built using wasm and have been tested using Chrome and Firefox.

The code has been adapted from the [WebGui](https://github.com/jnmaloney/WebGui) example by jnmaloney.

The latest [rosbridge_suite](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite) is needed
to get the effective [`cbor-raw` encoding](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite/commit/dc7fcb282d1326d573abe83579cc7d989ae71739) when subscribing to messages in the browser.

## Package dependencies

You will need to get the latest `rosbridge_suite` (see below).
But to get all its dependencies, it's easiest to just install the binary package first:
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-rosbridge-suite
```
For some reason, I've seen problems where you also need to install the `bson` and `tornado`
python libraries. These should already be pulled in by the above command. If not, do:
```
sudo apt install python-bson python-tornado
```

## Running the example with std_msgs

First clone the latest rosbridge_suite to your catkin workspace:
```
git clone https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite
```
Then compile that aswell as this package within the catkin workspace, source and launch using
```
roslaunch roswasm_webgui example.launch
```
Then navigate to `localhost:8080` to the see the webpage.

If you want to get some more interesting stuff to play with,
try launching with [mon launch](http://wiki.ros.org/rosmon) instead.
roswasm_webgui has good facilities for remote launching using this tool.
The example [tmux startup script](https://github.com/nilsbore/roswasm_webgui/blob/master/scripts/example.sh)
demonstrates how the tool can be used to remotely start up a system.

## Running with SAM custom ROS msgs (for sim and AUV)


First clone the latest rosbridge_suite to your catkin workspace:
```
git clone https://github.com/RobotWebTools/rosbridge_suite
```
Then compile that aswell as this package within the catkin workspace, source and launch using
```
roslaunch roswasm_webgui sam_webgui.launch namespace:=sam1
```
Then navigate to `localhost:8080` to the see the webpage.
If you want the page on SAM's computer(the jetson/xavier) with  IP `1.2.3.4`(this is SAM's IP) to be accessible from
another computer(this is the computer on your lap) on the network, you have to provide another parameter:
```
roslaunch roswasm_webgui sam_webgui.launch rosbridge_ip:=1.2.3.4 namespace:=sam1
```
You will then be able to access the page from another computer on
the network at the address `1.2.3.4:8080`.

## *NOT NEEDED FOR RUNNING!* Building the packages

To build the wasm files that are served by this package, you need to download,
activate and source the [emscripten sdk](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions). The code has been tested with version `1.39.10` of emscripten.

Then, you need to get the roswasm submodule by typing `git submodule init --update` within this folder.
If you just want to build the example with `std_msgs`, simply
build it inside this folder by typing `make`. For the AUV
specific page, you need to also clone [sam_common](https://github.com/smarc-project/sam_common)
and build the package, and also replace the hardcoded include
path in the [make file](https://github.com/nilsbore/roswasm_webgui/blob/master/Makefile).
To build the AUV specific file, type `make sam`.
